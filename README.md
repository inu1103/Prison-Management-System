# Prison-Management-System
Let's allocate Prison to different criminals

This is a Web Application, designed to allocate the prisons to different prisoners according to the crime they committed. It includes several factors such as the crime could be murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc.

It has different operating pages at the Front-end side, which are designed using JAVA within NetBeans Framework. Some of them includes User Login, Admin Login, Guard Login, and many more as per the different section operaters of Prison. 

An online FIR will be filed against a criminal by the Admin, which includes the date and time of murder, type of murder, spot of murder, and a chargesheet. 

As a user, you can create your account and will be able to see the History of Prisoners and their crime report, but will not be able to change it.

As soon as an admin submits the details, it get stores securely to the Backend Database server, which is designed using PostgreSQL connection.

Similarly, as a prisoner is kept in a prison, different duties are given to them, like working as a food producing servant and for machinery mills.Thus, a Supervisor controls all this and reports to the account department for the sales made by the work.

A systematic Data Flow Diagram, Use Case, and an E-R Model has been given for reference.
